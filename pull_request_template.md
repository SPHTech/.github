> This PR template is the default for all application repositories across Data Engineering, Data Science, DPE, and Content Engineering. It is intended to give engineers across all teams an easy reference to change criteria which must be addressed under relevant circumstances. PRs are intended to be living "sub-repositories" until merged or closed, and it is expected that a PR be created as the first step of the execution development stage (after planning and design).
